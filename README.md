# Web_Code
Code that shows web development front and back end. 

Project1: Shows contact page, widgets page, and addcontact with google Api. (google api doesn't work anymore, but you can get what it would be it was enabled) 

Project2: Shows a cleaner verison of project 1

These project aren't fully functional because of databases and api's that aren't in use anymore.
